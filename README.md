#RayCaster in SDL
This is a raycasting engine built in SDL, inspired by classic games like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. While the engine is still a work in progress and not yet perfect, it's a solid foundation for understanding the basics of raycasting. There are some current limitations, such as out-of-bounds handling, texture mapping, and collision detection, but these are areas I plan to improve in the future. Feel free to explore the code, and stay tuned for updates as I continue to refine and enhance it!
